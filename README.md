Car Price Prediction Model
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting car prices using a machine learning approach. By leveraging various regression models, we analyze a dataset containing detailed information about different cars, including features like brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and more. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the market price of a car based on these attributes.

Key Highlights:
Data Processing: The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing, including cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables into numerical formats using One-Hot Encoding. Numerical features are standardized to ensure uniform scaling across the model.
Model Variety: Multiple regression models are tested, each offering different strengths in predicting car prices. These models include Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Lasso Regression.
Model Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using key metrics, including the R² score, which measures the explanatory power of the model, and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which quantifies the accuracy of predictions.
Best Model Selection: The model achieving the highest R² score is selected as the final model for deployment and future predictions.
Project Structure
cars_info.csv: The dataset file containing various car attributes.
model_evaluation_results.csv: A CSV file containing the evaluation results of each model, including R² scores and Mean Absolute Error values.
best_model.pkl: The serialized best model saved using joblib. This model is the one with the highest performance in terms of prediction accuracy.
Libraries & Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations and array management.
seaborn: For data visualization, especially for statistical plots.
matplotlib: For basic plotting and visualizing model results.
scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and preprocessing steps.
joblib: For serializing and saving the best model for future use.
You can install these dependencies with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn joblib
How to Run
Step 1: Dataset Preparation
Ensure that the cars_info.csv dataset is placed in the Resources/ directory of the project structure.

Step 2: Script Execution
Run the Python script to perform the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The script will clean and process the data, transforming it into a format suitable for training the machine learning models.
Model Training & Evaluation: Several regression models will be trained, and their performance will be evaluated using the test set. Evaluation metrics, such as the R² score and MAE, will be computed.
Model Comparison: The results of all models will be visualized in comparison, allowing you to identify which model performs best.
Model Saving: The best-performing model will be serialized and saved as best_model.pkl.
Step 3: Results and Outputs
The model evaluation results (R² score and MAE) will be saved in a CSV file named model_evaluation_results.csv.
A variety of plots will be generated, including:
Scatter plots comparing the actual vs. predicted car prices for each model.
A bar plot comparing the R² scores of all models.
The final best model will be saved as best_model.pkl.
Step 4: Using the Saved Model for Predictions
To use the trained model for future predictions, you can load the saved best_model.pkl and input new car data to predict its price. Here’s an example of how to do that:

python
Copy
Edit
import joblib

# Load the best model
best_model = joblib.load('best_model.pkl')

# Example input data (ensure it is preprocessed in the same way as training data)
input_data = {  
    'Brand': 'Toyota',
    'Model': 'Corolla',
    'Year': 2020,
    'Mileage': 30000,
    # Add other relevant features as required
}

# Predict the price
predicted_price = best_model.predict([input_data])
print(f"Predicted Price: ${predicted_price[0]:,.2f}")
Model Performance
The following models were trained and evaluated for car price prediction:

Linear Regression: A simple, interpretable model that predicts prices using a linear relationship between features.
Random Forest Regressor: A powerful ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: A model that builds an ensemble of trees sequentially to correct errors made by previous trees.
Lasso Regression: A linear model that includes L1 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Evaluation Metrics
R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable (car price) that is explained by the model. A higher value means better performance.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions, giving insight into the model’s accuracy.
Model Comparison
After training and evaluating the models, a comparison of their R² scores reveals which model best fits the data. The model with the highest R² score is selected as the final model.
